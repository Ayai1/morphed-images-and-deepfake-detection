# Deepfake & Morphed Image Detection 

## 📌 Project Overview
A Python-based project on detecting **morphed images** and **deepfakes** using object detection techniques.

## 🛠 Technologies & Tools
- **Python**
- **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**
- **Label Studio**

## ⚠️ Challenges
- Dataset limitations and scarcity

## 🌱 Future Improvements
- Expand the dataset with real-world deepfake and morph examples
- Experiment with additional models beyond YOLO 
- Use video frame detection for deepfake videos

## 🤝 Open for Collaboration
